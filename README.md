# QCompare
The goal of this project is to compare the speed of several quantum machine learning framework in detail.
To be more specific, I will test the speed of simulating some famouse quantum machine learning algorithms.
I mainly focus on using torch quantum, pennylane, qiskit and cirq to implement the algorithms.
